# The Perl 6 Venturi module

Create URIs, mostly because I need to be able to manipulate query strings.

## Installation

Install it with [zef](https://github.com/ugexe/zef), which comes with
the latest [Rakudo Star](http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo/). This module is not in the module list yet (on purpose) so you need to grab it from GitHub:

	zef install https://github.com/briandfoy/Venturi

You can also checkout the [latest sources](https://github.com/briandfoy/Venturi) then install from that directory:

	zef install .

## Contributing

Fork the [Venturi](https://github.com/briandfoy/Venturi), edit, commit, and send a pull request!

If it's something non-trivial, you might consider [opening an issue](https://github.com/briandfoy/Venturi/issues) first.
